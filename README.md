<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

![Project Screenshot](/src/screenshot.png "Placeholder Screenshot")

This project is a collaboration between [Duck Labs](http://ducklabs.com/) and [EvolveU](https://www.evolveu.ca/) that aims to teach students the entirety of the spectrum of full-stack web development, starting with the visuals and UX of the front-end, and ending with the database and server communcation of the back-end, with the result being a complete and functional website.

Specifically, this work is meant to exemplify the pedagogy of **Project-based Learning**. PBL is an instructional methodology that encourages students to learn and apply knowledge and skills through an engaging experience. PBL presents opportunities for deeper learning in-context and for the development of important skills tied to career readiness.

**Why Project-based Learning?**

In essence, the PBL model consists of these seven characteristics:

-   Focuses the student on a big open-ended question, challenge, or problem to research and respond to and/or solve.
-   Brings what students should academically know, understand, and be able to do into the equation.
-   Is inquiry-based.
-   Uses 21st-century skills such as critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity, among others.
-   Builds student choice into the process.
-   Provides opportunities for feedback and revision of the plan and the project.
-   Requires students to present their problems, research process, methods, and results.

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.

-   [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com)
-   [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
-   [express](https://expressjs.com/)
-   [EJS](https://ejs.co/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

For development, you will only need Node.js and NPM installed in your environement.

### Prerequisites

-   #### Node installation on Windows

    Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
    Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

-   #### Node installation on Ubuntu

    You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the following commands.

        $ sudo apt install nodejs
        $ sudo apt install npm

-   #### Other Operating Systems
    You can find more information about the installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

    $ node --version
    v20.x.x

    $ npm --version
    10.x.x

If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.

    $ npm install npm -g

---

## Installation

    $ git clone https://github.com/brennanbrown/duck-project.git
    $ cd duck-project
    $ npm i

### Running the project

    $ npm start

Once the server has started up, you can visit it at [localhost:3000/](localhost:3000/), or [127.0.0.1:3000/](127.0.0.1:3000/).

### Deploying to Heroku

Ensure you are on Node 20 locally and that the lockfile matches dependencies.

1. Install Node 20 (using nvm) and use it:

        nvm install 20 && nvm use 20

2. Regenerate the lockfile to match updated dependencies:

        rm -f package-lock.json
        npm install

3. Test locally:

        npm start

4. Commit and push changes:

        git add -A
        git commit -m "chore: upgrade to Node 20, align Bootstrap 5, update CDNs and CSP"
        git push origin <your-branch>

5. Deploy to Heroku (replace <your-branch> if needed):

        git push heroku <your-branch>:main
