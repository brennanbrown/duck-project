    <h1 id="welcome">Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>

    <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio! Here, you'll find a showcase of my work in DevOps and cloud infrastructure, where I blend cutting-edge technologies with best practices to deliver robust, scalable solutions.</p>

    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>This portfolio features a web application originally developed by <a href="https://github.com/brennanbrown/duck-project">Brennan Brown</a>, whose work provided the foundation for this project. The back-end is powered by Node.js with the Express framework, and Embedded JavaScript Templating (EJS) was used for the views.</p>

    <h3>Infrastructure Implementation</h3>
    <p>To bring this application to life in a production environment, I engineered a cloud infrastructure using AWS and Terraform. The infrastructure includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>VPC Configuration: A custom Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) was created to isolate and secure the network.</li>
        <li>Subnet Design: Both public and private subnets were configured to manage traffic effectively.</li>
        <li>Security Groups: Specific security groups were set up to control inbound and outbound traffic, ensuring that only necessary communication is allowed.</li>
        <li>EC2 Instances: Amazon EC2 instances were provisioned within the public and private subnets to run the application services securely and efficiently.</li>
        <li>Routing and Internet Access: An Internet Gateway and a public route table were implemented to allow internet access for the public subnet.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This project exemplifies my ability to integrate complex infrastructure with modern application development, ensuring both reliability and scalability.</p>

    <h3>Deployment</h3>
    <p>The application is currently hosted on Heroku under a free Dyno plan, which might affect speed or connectivity. However, the underlying AWS infrastructure I created ensures a solid foundation for future scaling and enhancements.</p>

    <p>Feel free to explore the source code and infrastructure details. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome!</p>
